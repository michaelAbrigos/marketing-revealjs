					<h1>Elements of Strategic Plan</h1>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>Vision Statement</h2>
						<p>A vision statement is an aspirational statement of where you want your unit to be in the future.</p>
						<p class="fragment">“Future” is usually defined as the next three to five years, but it could be more.</p>
						<p class="fragment">A vision describes the “what” and the “why” for everything you do.</p>
					</section>

						<h2>Google's Vision Statement</h2>
						<blockquote>“To provide access to the world’s information in one click.”</blockquote>
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>Mission Statement</h2>
							<p>While a vision describes where you want to be in the future, a mission statement describes what you do today.</p>
							<p class="fragment">Focusing on your mission each day should enable you to reach your vision.</p>
							<p class="fragment">A mission statement could broaden your choices, and/or narrow them.</p>
					</section>

					</section>

				<section>
					<h2>SWOT Analysis</h2>
					<p>SWOT stands for strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. A SWOT analysis sums up where you are now and provides ideas on what you need to focus on.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Long-Term Goals</h2>
					<p>
						Long-term goals are three to five statements that drill down a level below the vision and describe how you plan to achieve your vision.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Yearly Objectives</h2>
					<p>Each long-term goal should have a few (three to five) one year objectives that advance your goals. Each objective should be as “SMART” as possible: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Time-based.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Action Plans</h2>
					<p>Each objective should have a plan that details how the objective will be achieved. The amount of detail depends on the complexity of the objective.</p>
					<p>It’s been said that  “A vision without a plan is just a dream. A plan without a vision is just drudgery. But a vision with a plan can change the world.”</p>
