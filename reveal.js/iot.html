					<p>The 'thing' could be anything from a shoe, watch to medical instruments and household devices. But a 'thing' needs to have certain qualities to be part of the 'Internet of Things'. </p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h1>How can a 'thing' become part of the 'Internet of Things'?</h1>
				</section>
				<section><video src="how.mp4" controls="full"></video></section>
				<section>
					<h2>Unique identity</h2>
					<p class="fragment">Integration with the Internet implies that the 'things' can use IP address as a unique identifier. However, due to the limited address space of IPv4 (which allows for 4.3 billion unique addresses), objects in the IoT will have to use IPv6 to accommodate the extremely large address space requirement.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p class="fragment">2^128 internet address = 340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,456</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Ability to wirelessly communicate</h2>
					<p class="fragment">The things in IoT are not of much use unless they can interact with each other and the user. So it is absolutely essential to be able to communicate, preferably wirelessly, with the things. The communication could be one-way or two-way depending on the nature and purpose of the 'thing’. And the communication protocol has to be lightweight and efficient.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Ability to sense</h2>
					<p class="fragment">Things in IoT need to have some kind of sensory capabilities to detect events or changes and provide a corresponding output. In addition to sensory capabilities, they could also provide actuation capabilities (e.g., light bulbs or locks controlled over the Internet).</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Ability to be controlled remotely</h2>
					<p class="fragment">Another quality expected of 'things’ in IoT is the ability to control them remotely over the internet. Ideally, physical proximity to the device should not be a pre-requisite.</p>
					<p class="fragment">With the advancements in pervasive or ubiquitous computing and thanks to Moore’s law, even tiny 'things’ with embedded logic, unique identifiers and the ability to wirelessly transfer data over the internet, can be part of the Internet-of-Things.</p>

					<h2><u>2008-2009</u> The Internet of Things was "Born" </h2>
					<p>According to Cisco Internet Business Solutions Group (IBSG), the Internet of Things was born in between 2008 and 2009 at simply the point in time when more “things or objects” were connected to the Internet than people.</p>
				</section>
				<section>

					<h2>The Internet of Everything (IoE)</h2>
					<p>brings together people, process, data, and things to make networked connections more relevant and valuable than ever before-turning information into actions that create new capabilities, richer experiences, and unprecedented economic opportunity for businesses, individuals, and countries.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>In simple terms:</h2>
					<p>The Internet of Everything (IoE) describes a world where billions of objects have sensors to detect measure and assess their status; all connected over public or private networks using standard and proprietary protocols.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p> Internet of Things (​IoT​) emphasis on  machine-to-machine (​M2M​) communications to describe a more complex system that also encompasses people and processes.</p>

				<h2>Pillars of The Internet of Everything (IoE) </h2>
				<p class="fragment">People</p>
				<p class="fragment">Data</p>
				<p class="fragment">Process</p>
				<p class="fragment">Things</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2>People</h2>
				<p>Although people are increasingly connecting together through smart devices and social media, IoE emergence is expected to fuel even more accelerated adoption of wearable gadgets, digestible sensor pills, custom body parts, connected apparel and similar technologies.</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2>Data</h2>
				<p>Data is considered new currency if leveraged appropriately in the form of information, knowledge and wisdom. It may not be surprising to see IoE data volumes surpass the traffic generated by today’s most popular social media sites – combined.</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h1> “Data is money."</h1>
				<p>-Nick Jones</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2>Process</h2>
				<p>Processes will play a pivotal role in how all the other IoE elements — people, data, and things —interact with one another to deliver societal benefits and economic value. End-to-end automation of technology, business, organizational and other processes delivering right information to right entities at the right time could trigger explosive growth for Internet of Everything.</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2>Things</h2>
				<p> Things represent the “T” in IoT — devices, sensors, actuators, meters — that connect to the network and to one another to enable smarter decision making at appropriate points in the network. </p>

					<h1>The Bad (Challenges)</h1>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Standards and Protocols</h2>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p class="fragment">Standards is a document that specifies something that has the overwhelming support and agreement of the standards making body.</p>
					<p class="fragment">For example of standards, in hardware: Bluetooth,Display port,HDMI,USB,RAID,UEFI</p>
					<p class="fragment">For software:ECMAScript,HTML,OpenGL,PNG,SVG,SQL </p>

				</section>
				<section>
				<p class="fragment">Protocol is a set of rules or procedures for transmitting data between electronic devices, such as computers. In order for computers to exchange information, there must be a preexisiting agreement as to how the information will be structured and how each side will send and receive it.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p class="fragment">Without a protocol, a transmitting computer, for example, could be sending its data in 8-bit packets while the receiving computer might expect 16-bit packets.</p>
					<p class="fragment">Perhaps the most important computer protocol is the OSI(Open Systems Interconnection), a set of guidelines for implementing networking communications between computers. Other example of protocols are TCP/IP, HTTPS, SMPT and DNS.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Lack of  Standards</h2>
					<p class="fragment">As with all new technologies, the battle over standards is always a struggle.</p>
					<p class="fragment">The challenge mainly lies with developing an effective cross-industry technology reference architecture that will allow for true interoperability and ease of deployment. The fragmented M2M and Smart Systems vendor landscape that is not yet well aligned with the larger IT infrastructure and network services players also contributes to the issue.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>The IoT protocol war</h2>
					<p class="fragment">Qualcomm developed a communication protocol for IoT, named AllJoyn</p>
					<p class="fragment">Google announced a new networking protocol called Thread that aims to create a standard for communication between household devices.</p>
					<p class="fragment">There are competing special purpose low-level protocols like Z-Wave, Zigbee, Bluetooth Low Energy (BTLE) protocol and many more.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Environmental impact</h2>
					<p class="fragment">The possible explosion of e-waste is another growing concern. The rapid mushrooming of small electronic devices could significantly contribute to the already growing e-waste.</p>
					<p class="fragment">To minimize environmental impact, efficiency and robustness of 'things’ become extremely important. Since 'things’ are generally running 24x7x365, and are equipped with wireless capabilities, the power requirements need to be managed really efficiently. </p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>The Internet of (Expensive) Things</h2>
					<p class="fragment">Smartness comes at a cost! In its current state, the 'things’ in IoT are expensive.</p>
					<p class="fragment">Take smart home devices for example. Belkin WeMo wireless light switch costs about $42. A smart thermostat like Nest costs about $250, as against $25 for a not-so-smart one. Philips Hue, a wireless light bulb costs about $60. Imagine what it would cost to have smart switches and light bulbs everywhere in your house!</p>

					<h1>The Ugly (Concerns)</h1>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Security</h2>
					<p class="fragment">Products are often sold with old and unpatched embedded operating systems and software. Furthermore, purchasers often fail to change the default passwords on devices - or if they do change them, fail to select sufficiently strong passwords.</p>
					<p class="fragment">A study from Hewlett-Packard found that 70% of the most commonly used IoT devices contain vulnerabilities - or in other words, they can be hacked!</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>IoT - a hacker’s delight!</h3>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment">Computer scientists at the University of Michigan hacked into “smart” traffic lights with nothing more than a laptop and basic radio broadcast equipment.</li>
						<li class="fragment">Hackers at the Black Hat security conference compromised a Nest thermostat in front of a live audience.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment">BBC recently assembled a team of seven computer security experts and let them loose in a home full of “smart” devices. In short order, they cracked the security on every last one of them. “The one that people really get concerned about is the microphone on a smart TV,” said one expert. “We were able to bug a living room through it.”</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>IoT - weapons of mass disruption?</h2>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment">WiFi pacemaker hack: In the late 2000s, scientists demonstrated a WiFi pacemaker hack with which one could take control of the device.</li>
						<li class="fragment">Iran nuclear experts race to stop spread of Stuxnet computer worm: Stuxnet, a 500-kilobyte computer worm that the software of at least 14 industrial sites in Iran, including a uranium-enrichment plant.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment">Insulin pump hack delivers fatal dosage over the air: At the Hacker Halted conference in Miami, the attack on wireless insulin pumps was demonstrated. The attack hijacks nearby insulin pumps, enabling the attacker to surreptitiously deliver fatal doses to diabetic patients.</li>
						<li class="fragment">Car electronics taken over remotely: The electronics within a car can be hacked, taking control of the headlights, locks, steering and even the brakes.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<video src="Car.mp4" controls="full"></video>
				</section>
				<section>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment">Smart meter hacks: The best case: smart meters can be hacked to cut power bills. The worst case: A criminal who can hack your smart metering utility system can identify when usage drops and assume that means nobody is home.</li>
						<li class="fragment">Printer firmware hacking: Canon Pixma printers firmware was modified from the Internet to run custom code - not just any custom code - the classic 90s computer game Doom! That’s not very scary. But imagine this - the firmware can be hacked to send a copy of every document printed on that printer to the hacker!</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Privacy</h2>
					<p class="fragment">The impact of IoT on consumer privacy is another major concern. Smart homes also mean more hackable devices at home. Every internet connected device increases the possibility of breach of privacy, autonomy and control.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p class="fragment">Hackers who could only virtually spy on your computer until recently could now potentially spy on you in your own house! With facial recognition, voice recognition built into TVs, the possibility of snooping using the TV is pretty high.</p>
